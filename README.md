# R_Learning_Course

Welcome to the R Learning Course repository! This guide is designed to take you from a beginner to (hopefully) a professional level in the fascinating and comprehensive R programming language.



## Contents

- **Scripts:** Find step-by-step scripts in R describing actions to be performed in R Studio. These scripts are aimed at helping you learn R in a structured manner.

- **Completed Versions:** Discover the complete and answered versions of each script in a 'DONE' folder. Use these to examine your answers and reinforce your learning.



## Recommended Tools

This repository is designed to be used with the R Studio program for teaching. R Studio provides a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for working with the R programming language.

It is highly recommended that learners use R Studio for the best experience in understanding and practicing R.

However, for temporary and mandatory purposes (such as an unwanted academic unit), you can use https://colab.research.google.com/.
